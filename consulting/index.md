Product engineering
===================

*After working with a few companies, this doc aims to address a few key
problems:*

-   *There are lots of unknowns as you launch a new product - I should
    not be one of them. To that end, I provide known capabilities, price and availability.*
-   *It is difficult for non-technical people to find
    technical expertise. I list what I can do AND what I cannot do in human friendly terms.*
-   *Pricing should reflect alignment on 'do everything to get this
    thing to launch. To that end, I've arrived at retainer + goal pricing.*
-   *Commitments should end with a deliverable I can add to
    my portfolio.*
-   *Process should help me quickly identify and filter out projects
    that are not a good fit.*

I am a freelance product focused engineer who helps companies build
innovative digital products people love. I specialize working with early
stage startups but have experience both managing teams to deliver on
deadlines and integrating into large teams to expand capacity.

I believe it is important to have someone on the engineering team who
understands the product vision and who can continue to revise the
technical strategy as new opportunities come to light. I am the person
for that role. Given my engineering experience working closely with
design and product resources at MIT CSAIL and variety of startups
(Artsy, Jumo, Motivate), I have a record of making beautiful products a
reality. Making beautiful products also happens to be what I love doing
:)

*My consulting philosophy is informed by the minds of* [*Sandwich Video*](http://sandwichvideo.com/how-it-works/), [*Dynamo*](http://www.godynamo.com/), [*Nick Barr*](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Get-product-fit-MZaoett7Wg26s8QbU95la) *and* [*201 Created*](http://www.201-created.com/)

What I do
---------

I consult with your team to help document and then build a focused web
product that meets your goals while satisfying your constraints. I work
in an iterative fashion by delivering the simplest possible version of
the product first. Then, you'll get to see it come alive and mature as
we improve upon it steadily through weekly iterations. I will provide
you with valuable feedback and direction along the way.

I am an engineer who can work across the product side and the business
side. I love building things people use. Together, we will identify your
customer and give them a product they love that solves a problem they
care about -- all within a budget you can cope with.

I specialize in prototyping and launching new products. Specifically, I
am fluent in creating:

-   Prototypes using a combination of code and "off-the-shelf" tools
    like [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) or
    [Zapier](https://www.zapier.com)
-   Rich interactive applications using React or Backbone
-   Backends using Node/Express or Ruby/Rails
-   Interactive data visualizations using D3.js (example project:
    [vislet.com](http://vislet.com))
-   Highly tested applications to ensure reliability
-   Data driven projects and applications
-   Managing small engineering teams to ensure delivery of high quality
    product to meet deadlines.
-   Optimizing the use of my time and the team to suit business needs

I do **not** specialize in

-   Native iOS or Android apps (at least not yet!)
-   Legacy code in PHP/Wordpress or languages/frameworks not listed
    above
-   AI or âbig dataâ related software infrastructure
-   Blockchain related software
-   Assuming what you want - I will ask lots of questions!


What we will do
---------------

First, we talk. Send me an email at brennanmoore@gmail.com and tell me
what youâre working on. No need for a lot of detailâjust some words
about your thing, what it is, who will use it, why you think it should
exist and how you see me helping. I'll get back to you quicker than
you'd expect.

Next we will find out more. We will start by defining where we want to
end up. What will you say to the company about what we did together?
What will you communicate publicly about what we did together?

After defining where we want to end up, we will work together as a
group, to write out the problem we are solving and our goals for the
project. We will arrive at common language to describe the problem and
document the target audience for the end product.

Based on our conversations, I will price the project, set a schedule and
start building.

What it will cost
-----------------

I don't really provide highly-detailed estimates -- at least not in the
way you might be accustomed.

What I do is try to "size up" your project so you have a good idea of
the time and cost required to do a great job building you a world-class
product.

It has been my experience that beginning a project based on a very
detailed spec (or RFP) is the surest path to mutual disappointment. Too
much detail sets out specific expectations in terms of features and
functionality. The trouble is that, in the digital world, a great
strategy is constantly in development. The important features bubble to
the top as we are working together, not before you choose who to work
with. This makes it impossible to predict exactly how I'll spend my
time, so if we make these predictions we'd both just be hoping we were
right. And hope isn't a great strategy when it comes to building a
website/product.

I will work with you in an iterative fashion to deliver the best product
I can. As a result, we structure our partnership as monthly retainers
whereby you are essentially buying a consistent amount of hours per
month. As we work together, we will discuss if that number of hours
needs to be adjusted. Before starting, I can also provide you with the
option of a smaller, standalone Discovery Phase designed to properly and
more accurately define the scope and time required. This is a great
choice if you are not too sure about the current set of features you
have outlined.

I highly encourage splitting compensation between the retainer and
performance (meeting a launch date or a particular goal).

You should expect to keep working with me after "launch" on a retainer
that works for you.

**Projects usually fall into one of three categories:**

1.  **Small, bootstrapped startups.** Usually these project require
    creative technical solutions where I prototype the project using
    âoff the shelf toolsâ and some custom code. These projects cost
    one dollar sign. **$**
2.  **Reasonably well-funded startups.** These projects are usually
    geared at improving on a known opportunity and require building rich
    interactive applications that stand out in the market. These
    projects cost two dollar signs. **$$**
3.  **Big corporations.** These can be fun because there are resources
    to do things correctlyâto make things look and perform amazingly
    well, and because big companies have been known to innovate just as
    well as smaller, more agile ones. These projects cost three
    dollar signs. **$$$**

Last thing you should know is that you can be as large or as small a
part of the process as you like. Some clients enjoy brainstorming
engineering solutions and others want no part of that. I'm here to
work with you.

Most importantly, I'm here to work with innovative people making good
products. When I get to do that, all goes well.
