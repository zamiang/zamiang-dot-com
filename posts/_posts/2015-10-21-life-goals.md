Over the past year, I walked away from two great jobs, at [Artsy.net](https://www.artsy.net/) and Motivate, the parent company of [Citi Bike](https://www.citibikenyc.com/). At Artsy, I worked with the dream team to make the Art world accessible by bringing the world's art online. I grew disillusioned by exclusion and wealth in the art world, so I left to join Motivate, which was offering New York its first new public-transportation service in decades through its bike-share system. I made the switch because I wanted to help build great public services; it's important to me to help build things that will meaningfully improve people's lives. Even then, I overcorrected and focused on getting what I was missing at Artsy rather than seeing my life holistically. Ultimately it proved taxing to work on a small, overburdened team in an office that didn't even have air conditioning. Rather than running straight to the next thing, I am taking some time to assess my priorities and determine exactly what I'm looking for.

While working on these next steps, I've developed a little process to focus my thinking, which I hope to repeat for years to come. This process started by examining my life through three frames provided by the greatest Canadian philosopher of our time, Aubrey Graham (aka Drake).

- **The Motto** "You only live once": Identify opportunities for positive changes to my career
- **The Motion** "That phone doesn't ring when they got everything": Remove toxic elements from both my work and life
- **Find Your Love** "I better find your loving, I better find your heart": Identify opportunities for positive changes to my personal life

The basic steps to this method involves articulating your goals and breaking them down into things you want to grow or expand upon within your career and/or personal life. Then you conversely think about things you want to remove from these areas of your life. Finally, you come up with some actionable items you can hold yourself to. While you may not end up wanting to quit your job and write blog posts based on some Drake tracks, this format is (hopefully!) a useful way to frame life changes. Let's get started!

# [The Motto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDKK95cpfM)

Looking back on my previous jobs, I've done interesting research, written "good code," designed some elegant products, and had wonderful experiences mentoring and organizing teams of engineers. But at the end of the day, I am not an academic, computer scientist, designer, or career manager. It's taken me a long time to realize it, but I am at heart a maker. Building beautiful tools that people use is my passion. I am a product-focused engineer who wants to build applications that people use―that people _love_ to use.

With that guiding principle in mind, I now want to concentrate on how I can own it in a responsible way. This year, I plan to apply my skills to help young companies prototype their businesses. We will first explore and document their product visions, goals, and expectations. This work will draw on Nicole Fenton's ideas in ["Words as Material,"](http://www.nicolefenton.com/words-as-material/) where she advocates using words, rather than designs, to understand and clarify what the team will create. We will then interview users and build prototypes, further testing business hypotheses and confirming demand.

Having identified this high-level direction, the challenge will be to stay focused putting one foot in front the other. I've joined  [Orbital NYC](http://orbital.nyc/), "a home for developing and launching new ideas," where I am refining the prototype methods I'll use with clients. Outside of Orbital, I am continuing to hone my practice of making create, user-focused digital products. I am currently working with two companies (and would love to expand that list!). I plan to spend about 40 hours a month with each company, helping them realize an initial product. Eventually I'll transition out as we build up internal teams.

Beyond doing things I enjoy, I also need to disengage from things that are toxic. Bad jobs are something that every freelancer will encounter, however, they are difficult to exit. I almost want to apply the [Marie Kondo](http://tidyingup.com/) method for simplifying, organizing, and storing possessions to the way I approach freelance jobs.

My worst self―my apathetic self―comes out when I don't know if I am delivering value, or even worse, when I know I am working on a project that doesn't. While I recognize that marketing is an important way to reach people, there is little that I can meaningfully contribute to marketing-oriented projects. Great design makes a marketing website deliver value; great engineering does not. It may be a bit of a false dichotomy to separate marketing work from product work, but I've decided not to work on more marketing websites for the coming year, only on functional products. By trimming my work down to the work I really care about, I can better grow in the areas where I am most needed and do what matters most. For example, this focus has let me spend more time developing my writing and forming this very post.

Our culture nearly forces us to "work hard and play hard." Work gets prioritized over everything else until we reach a breaking point. A couple of years ago, I was extremely burnt out and took a three-week vacation to Thailand to recharge. I had gone 3 years without a vacation and, while I was accomplishing a lot, I was also living an unsustainable life.

This part of our method is about looking at the things you value in your personal life and setting a few goals to expand upon each of them over the coming year. It's about integrating small changes that together will make your life more deeply about the things you love. Ultimately, the aim is to grow from within rather than engaging in a cycle of burning out and resetting.

Here are some examples that I personally plan to implement over the next year:

## Community

Community is undervalued in our society with its hero myth of the lone genius inventor. As [Gary Chou](http://garychou.com/) of [Orbital NYC](http://orbital.nyc/) says, your success is determined more by your network than your passion or skills. I feel my network stagnating a bit as I grow older: it takes far more time and energy to make meaningful connections than it used to. Being a part of tech in Boston felt like I belonged to a special niche. Now that I'm further along in my career and based in New York, any casual hangout is tinged with concerns about networking. Every project, no matter how small, ends up focusing on profitability or career utility. I would like to get get back to critiquing ideas and sharing projects.

*Goal*: Meet someone new at least once a week, potentially by reaching out to my twitter network. Make these new connections meaningful.

## Tea

I love tea for its depth of flavor and because I can use it to wake up without viscerally shaking like with coffee. I've loved the stuff since I could safely handle boiling water and rare teas have been among my Christmas gifts since middle school. This year, I've deepened my appreciation beyond flavor by exploring the culture of tea. I read the  [Serious Eats guide to tea](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/tea-for-everyone.html) and attended [Gong Fu tea ceremonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongfu_tea_ceremony) in Flushing with my roommate.

*Goal*: Dive deep into the world of Chinese Tea by visiting my roommate, Christina Xu, while [she does research in China](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/christinaxu/multi-entry-telling-the-stories-of-young-creative).

## Beautiful Things

As superficial as it may seem, thoughtful design makes me really happy. As an engineer, I'm fortunate enough that I can buy an expensive teacup without thinking too much about it. It doesn't enhance the flavor of the tea in any way, but using it every day makes me reminds me to slow down and take the time to make things I'm proud of.

*Goal*: Over the next year, buy one beautiful but unnecessary thing that makes me happy.

## Writing

I struggle with words. For me the practice of writing is like stabbing around in the dark but with a toy receding knife so I can't even tell if I hit anything or not. Without the visual cues of conversation, I don't have a clear understanding of whether my points hit home. Are they interesting or do they fall flat from lack of context?

Still, writing is something I really love doing. It helps me work through ideas and is really one of the most important things I do: in our age of email, twitter, and gchat, effective writing is easily the most useful professional skill one can have.

*Goal*: Hire an editor or someone to help improve my writing process. [Check this one off! ―ed.]

In conclusion, I'm excited about these changes, but I know the coming year will be challenging as well as interesting. I wrote this as I watched women's tennis at the US Open. It was truly inspiring seeing a much older, much less powerful #157 seed win over a highly athletic #4 seed. I found a lot of parallels between her performance and the process I'm going through―I am not a #4 seed engineer or product thinker. She won not by being stronger, but by staying focused and out-positioning her opponent. I hope to do the same over the next year by finding a unique placement within the engineering and startup space, where I can be most effective.
