As it has now raised over [50m](http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/03/26/catterton-leads-25-million-funding-round-for-artsy/), Artsy is treading dangerously close to being a real company. For those not familiar, Artsy is a website that seeks to bring the art market online, and in the process, make the art world, museums, fairs and all, easily accessible to everyone.

This is a quick writeup of some of the lessons I learned at Artsy. Truthfully, it was an incredible opportunity. Artsy does far more right than any company I've ever worked with. Building a company is challenging beyond comprehension, I was at the company for over 3 years as the team grew from 15 people to about 90. I'm sure each of those 90 people have their own list of things Artsy does right or wrong, but this list is mine in the hopes that it helps me build on Artsy's success in future roles.

## Hiring

Some of the



## Product at Artsy

The most contentious issue in a growing startup is product ownership and communication around product changes.



he problems we face today are very different than the ones we faced when try to merely build a product that works and art inspires me less than it has in the past. In short, there is higher impact work that I could be working on that I am not working on now. I am in a position where I can make these moves now and I need to do so.

Today, we are a metrics (KPI) driven product company and that makes a lot of sense for taking a faux-company into a real business. But these are not the problems that I am passionate about. I don't think about metrics for how to optimize our SEO, conversion flows etc. They just aren't problems that excite me. Which, may be entirely as a result of the second problem

I joined Artsy with something of a perspective that we were going to help art have impact. Currently, artworks are made in a tiny studio, go to a gallery and then if they are lucky, into some warehouse in new jearsy. Because of artsy, they now at least are on the interent. There is some oportiniy for interested people to discover those works. The next few years at Artsy will be about growing and getting value out of that audience.

teams built around KPIs so that they can turn down other projects

docker deploy to aws (?) avoid the need for orchestration

## Engineering at Artsy

We used mongo before we needed it and when the tools really weren't there. This led us to contribute a lot to the mongo ORM codebase. Some would argue that the prospect of this attracts great engineers - which you really need in the early stages when hiring is most challenging.

The team is truly incredible, I look back in horror at the engineer I was when I joined and that is 100% due to the quality of people I was around on a daily basis - constantly underwater striving to improve and be relevant among these remarkably humble titans.

artsy mistakes
reading from slaves instead of master in mongo
one service and one database instead of many services with their own database
maintaining an api targeted at the public is difficult (?maybe)
not standardising

artsy wins
Focus on OSS and Blogging
General high standard of qualty


Product mistakes


I also look in horror at the product thinker that I was before joining Artsy. It may not be something that I can do as well as some of the people here purly because I like to spend meetings watching, listening and thinking. I then have directed conversations with people afterwards. It isn't effiecent and is not the right strategy for a product leader but it often allows me to be at least relevant in a company.

Our chief mistake with Artsy has been in launching projects that are the right time for the business but the wrong time for the company. You may think that is exactly the right time to launch
