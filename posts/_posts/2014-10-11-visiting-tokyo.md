This is a quick run down of my experience visiting Tokyo for the first
time. I really just wanted to see what it would be like for me, a
white dude, to live in the city. As a result, I focused on a smaller
area where I would see myself living & working (Shinjuku &
Minato). Instead of visiting things to gawk at Japanese subcultures,
I just did the stuff I like. I am not Japanese, nor were many of the
people I hung out with and I don't speak the language. I'm am just
trying to see if I can live and learn in a wildly different place,
while remaining myself. So, ya know, take those perspectives into
account.

While fairly westernized, Japan is truly another world from the United
States end to end. From the cute little construction cones to a wholly
different philosophy for how you treat the space around you. The
differences and their nuances are often astounding. No amount of time
would allow me, or any non-japanese person to 'assimilate'. That is such
an incredibly wrong (and probably frustrating!) mindset for living in
Tokyo or anywhere your racial makeup will forever mark you an
outsider. Just be nice, don't try to be Japanese.

## Getting around Tokyo

Get a bike in Tokyo. Despite the lack of bike lanes, the city has
near-scandinavian level bike accommodations. There are big organized
sidewalks and traffic goes at a bike-able speed. Many
women bike with no helmet holding multiple babies. If you are familiar
with biking and driving, it is really a no brainer. The benefits are
simply that you learn the cvity instead of the train stations. Tokyo is
incredibly cavernous and is easily discoverable on a bike where you
can quickly stop to investigate some curiosity down an alleyway. For
navigating, I was able to use Google Maps cache and the iPhone GPS
(which works for CDMA phones). There are some strange rules about
where you can lock your bike but generally just try to lock it up near
other bikes. Last bit of advice, just remember to sing 'to the left,
to the left' pretty much all the time.

## Drinking

Bar culture is very american / european creation. Each Asian country
certainly has its history with alcohol but they incorporate 'bar
culture' into existing traditions in wildly different ways. It seems
like the differences are either reflection of when they modernized or
massive marketing campaigns. In Hong Kong, bar culture is fresh and is
mostly for the older or foreigner crowd. In Thailand, bar culture was
imported as bottle service clubs with live music. In Tokyo, drinking
happens in all kinds of ways, except at dinner. Bars often try to
build their own culture since they have a dedicated clientele from
doubling as stores or coffee shops during the day. We had many
interesting experiences since bars seem to take a quality of
'bars-ness' and push it to the extreme. We were kicked out of a very
quiet whisky bar for laughing and then went to a bar where buying a
drink allows you to pick the next song - a drunkards dream jukebox.

Public drinking is generally ok in Asia. One of my favorite moments
from the trip was on a 9AM train to Hakone, we sat next to a group of
old men who accumulated a crew and more beers as we went along. All
well dressed and just quietly having a great time as they drank their
way to the onsen.

# Interesting policies

When visiting a new place, I love learning about social policies that
express or address the areas unique challenges. For example, Hong Kong
has many policies simply to manage its relationship with mainland
China. Healthcare and infrastructure for 7 million people can't
support the demands of the 1+ billion people of mainland China as
expressed in the
[milkpowder customs policy](http://www.customs.gov.hk/en/whats_new/API/index.html). Thailand,
as a developing nation, prevents foreigners from buying land which
many inflate housing prices for the people actually living
there. Japan is a very formal culture. Due to the formality, it is
difficult to tell whether something is legal policy or merely
customary. I would love to learn about more policies but here are a
few that I found most interesting.

## Trash
Basically, it costs money to throw stuff away. Throwing away a desk
costs about $50 USD. This changes purchasing behavior and encourages
reuse. If there is anything I would want to take from Tokyo to the
USA, it would be this policy.

## Jay Walking

There is no jay walking except at night. When someone does jay walk,
the whole crowd follows. It seems that no one wants to be that 1st
person to break the rule.

## Building height restrictions

Tokyo is easily the most livable city I've ever visited and building
height restrictions are a huge part of that. Unlike cities with
limited space, Tokyo is an interesting reference for a large city like
Brooklyn. My guess is that building height restrictions creates even
population density around the city. Even density encourages even
transportation coverage via Buses or wide bike able
sidewalks.

# Basic travel tips
- Get a MiFi from the airport. About $20 a day from one of the cell stations
- Make sure your Credit Card has a chip and a pin number
- Get cash (errebody loves cash here)
- [Prepaid subway](http://www.jrpass.com/blogs/benefits-of-prepaid-travelcards) cards are very nifty
- Get some whisky in the airport for roughly 1/2 the price in the states. Gary recommends the [Yoichi 20 year](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/yoichi-20-year-old-whiskey/) and I love the [Hibiki 21 year](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/suntory-hibiki-21-year-old-blended-whisky)
- Tip is included
- 'To the left to the left'
- Look up restaurants on [Tabelog](http://tabelog.com/tokyo/)
- My favorite spots on [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/zamiang/list/tokyo-2014
)
- Hakone makes for a wonderful and affordable day trip ($20 each way)
