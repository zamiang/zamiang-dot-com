I walked away from two great jobs this year ([Artsy.net](https://www.artsy.net) and Motivate/[Citi Bike](https://www.citibikenyc.com)). When I moved from one job to the next, I likely overcorrected and focused on getting what I was missing rather than seeing the opportunity, or my life, holistically. Now, I am taking some time to figure out where to take that next step.

Looking back, I've done interesting research. While I love and respect my friends in academia, I am no academic. I've written "good code". While I love and respect my friends who do real computer science, I am not a computer scientist.

I am not a career manager, but I love mentoring and organizing an engineering team to be effective at making products. I am not a designer, but I am passionate about creating beautiful solutions to grow or realize business needs in a beautiful way..

Its taken me a long time to realize it, but I am a maker. "Building beautiful tools people use" is my carrier and my passion. With that career focus in mind, I can begin to acknowledge what I am interested in and to own it in a responsible way.

## [The Motto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDKK95cpfM)

My goal for the next year is to work with a 2-3 different groups each month to refine the practice of making great digital products.

I am a product focused engineer experienced building rich user facing web based products.

I am interested in helping early stage companies document their product goals/vision in high level but engineer-friendly terms. I can also help them build out an MVP to test the business hypothesis and see if the process as a whole works well. Ideally would spend ~40 hours a month with the company.

## [Know Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79AR0VC5wCA)

Beyond focusing my carrier, I also want to disengage with the things I am don't enjoy doing and to deliberately and thoroughly engage with the things I like doing.

Rather than take retreats, I try to find small things I can change about the things I already do, and monitor those changes.

Grow the hobbies that I actually like:

- **Tea** is great! I've loved tea since I could safely handle boiling water. The [searious eats guide to tea ](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/tea-for-everyone.html) and my roommate taking me to [Gonfu tea ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongfu_tea_ceremony) in Flushing quickly broadened the world of tea for me this year.
  - Goal: Go broad or go deep? This year I have some opportunity to deepen my appreciation for Chinese Tea, going to do that by...going to China for a lil bit.
- **Meditation** Going wide instead of deep is pretty much the story of my life up until this point. Meditation is something that really helped me in highschool, and now during this new transition.
  - Continue to use [Headspace App](https://www.headspace.com/) daily for one year
- **Community** My goal is to meet someone new at least once a week either by reaching out to my twitter network or otherwise.
- **Beautiful things** As superficial as it is, thoughtful design makes me really happy. As an engineer, I'm financially able to spend $100 on a tea cup and not think much of it.
- **Writing** I struggle with words pretty much all the time.
  - Goal: Hired an editor or someone to help with writing

Learn about my [Worst behavior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CccnAvfLPvE).

When am I my worst self? I need to better understand my worst self. While I would like to I think the stresses of freelancing will bring out many of those qualities. Even when I am well rested, I am at my worst when I have no clear direction but am also not empowered to effectively define a clear direction. I don't have an actionable 'goal' here but I do want to 'get to know my worst self.'

My worst self really comes out when when I don't know if I am delivering value, or even worse, knowing that I am working on a project that doesn't deliver value.
