1. why does this post exist?
2. what are my next career goals
3. personal goals
4. know yourself

I walked away from two great jobs within the past 6 months (Artsy.net and Motivate/Citi Bike). Seeking advice, friends tell me I should stop doing anything for about a while. When you move from one job to the next, you can 'over correct' and focus on getting what you are missing rather than seeing the opportunity, or your life, holistically. Now, trying to figure out where to take that next step, I am looking back to see how I arrived where I am.

I've done interesting research. While I love and respect my friends in academia, I am no academic. I've written "good code". While I love and respect my friends who do real computer science, I am not a computer scientist.

I am not a career manager, but I love mentoring and organizing an engineering team to be effective in making products. I am not a designer, but I am happy to help identify business problems and mockup solutions in a beautiful way.

Its taken me a long time to realize it, but I am a maker. "Building beautiful tools people use" is my carrier and my passion. With that career focus in mind, I can begin to acknowledge what I am interested in and to own it in a responsible way.

## [The Motto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDKK95cpfM)

My goal for the next year is to work with a 2-3 different groups each month to refine the practice of making great digital products.

Beyond focusing what I call my carrier, I also want to disengage with the things I am don't enjoy doing and to deliberately and thoroughly engage with the things I like doing.

Rather than take retreats, I try to find small things I can change about the things I already do, and monitor those changes.

- **Tea** A great intro by Max http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/tea-for-everyone.html and my roommate taking me to [Gonfu tea ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongfu_tea_ceremony) in flushing quickly tought me how little I know bout tea.
  - Goal:
- **Meditation** Going wide instead of deep is pretty much the story of my life up until this point.
  - Continue to use [Headspace App](https://www.headspace.com/) daily for one year
- **Community** My goal is to meet someone new at least once a week either by reaching out to my twitter network or otherwise.
- **Beautiful things** As superficial as it is, thoughtful design makes me really happy. As an engineer, I'm financially able to spend $100 on a tea cup and not think much of it.
- **Writing** I struggle with words pretty much all the time.

## [Worst behavior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CccnAvfLPvE)

When am I my worst self? I need to better understand my worst self. While I would like to I think the stresses of freelancing will bring out many of those qualities. Even when I am well rested, I am at my worst when I have no clear direction but am also not empowered to effectively define a clear direction. I don't have an actionable 'goal' here but I do want to 'get to know my worst self.'

## [Doing it wrong](https://vimeo.com/32002320)

I genuinely believe that Twitter has made me more empathetic and less productive -- and that is a tremendously good thing. While it isn't something I can directly credit, awareness of how a diverse set of people feel about sigular sets of events is
