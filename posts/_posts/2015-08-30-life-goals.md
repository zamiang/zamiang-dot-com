I walked away from two great jobs this year ([Artsy.net](https://www.artsy.net) and Motivate/[Citi Bike](https://www.citibikenyc.com)). My mistake when moving from one job to the next was that I overcorrected and focused on getting what I was missing rather than seeing the opportunity, or my life, holistically. Now, I am taking some time to figure out where to take that next step.

Looking back, I've done interesting research. While I love and respect my friends in academia, I am no academic. I've written "good code". While I love and respect my friends who do real computer science, I am not a computer scientist.

I am not a career manager, but I love mentoring and organizing an engineering team to be effective at making products. I am not a designer, but I am passionate about creating beautiful solutions to grow or realize business needs in a beautiful way...

Its taken me a long time to realize it, but I am a maker. "Building beautiful tools people use" is my carrier and my passion. With that career focus in mind, I can begin to acknowledge what I am interested in and to own it in a responsible way.

## [The Motto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDKK95cpfM)

My goal for the next year is to work with a 2-3 different groups each month to refine the practice of making great digital products.

I am a product focused engineer experienced building rich user facing web based products.

I am interested in helping early stage companies document their product goals/vision in high level but engineer-friendly terms. I can also help them build out an MVP to test the business hypothesis and see if the process as a whole works well. Ideally would spend ~40 hours a month with the company.

## [Know Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79AR0VC5wCA)

Beyond focusing my carrier, I also want to disengage with the things I am don't enjoy doing and to deliberately and thoroughly engage with the things I like doing. Rather than take retreats to totally reset, I plan to make small changes about daily life, and monitor those changes.

Here are some things I like that I plan to expand over the next year:

- **Tea** is great! I've loved tea since I could safely handle boiling water. The [Serious Eats guide to tea](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/tea-for-everyone.html) and my roommate taking me to [Gongfu tea ceremonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongfu_tea_ceremony) in Flushing quickly broadened the world of tea for me this year.
  - Goal: Go broad or go deep? This year I have some opportunity to deepen my appreciation and understanding of the wide world of Chinese Tea, by...going to China.
- **Meditation** is something that really helped me in middle and high school but is something I never diligently explored.
  - Goal: Continue to use [Headspace App](https://www.headspace.com/) daily for one year.
- **Community** is the under-sung hero in our society that focus on the myth of the individual creator. As Gary Chou says, your success is more determined more by your network than your passion or skills.
  - Goal: Meet someone new at least once a week either by reaching out to my twitter network or otherwise. Make these new connections meaningful.
- **Beautiful things** As superficial as it is, thoughtful design makes me really happy. As an engineer, I'm financially able to spend $100 on a tea cup and not think much of it.
  - Goal: Buy one beautiful, significant but totally unnecessary thing that makes me happy.
- **Writing** I struggle with words pretty much all the time.
  - Goal: Hire an editor or someone to help improve my writing process.
- **Freedom** from a list of goals. TODO
  - Goal: Travel to at least 3 different countries I've never been to over the next year

Next is to disengaging with the things I don't enjoy. Hobbies are easy to drop, I want to focus on dropping work that brings out my [Worst behavior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CccnAvfLPvE). My worst self, my apathetic self, comes out when when I don't know if I am delivering value, or even worse -- when I know I am working on a project that costs more than it is worth. While I see marketing as a way to reach people, constructing marketing websites is not my passion. Great design makes a marketing website deliver value; great engineering does not. While separating marketing work from product work may be a bit of a false dichotomy, in the next year I will work on no more marketing websites -- only functional products.

## Summary?

I hope this year will be an interesting one, I kicked it off watching Tennis. It was truly inspring Watching a much older, much less physically fit #157 seed beat the highly athletic #4 seed. More than that, it was a performance where I see a lot of parallels. I am not a #4 sees engineer or product thinker. She won not by being stronger, staying focused and by out positioning her shots. I hope to do the same over the next year by finding a unique placement within the engineering and startup space where I can be [best].
