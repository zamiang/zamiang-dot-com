## Live coding interviews are really about culture fit

I’ve always felt a bit of a tenuous relationships with live coding
interviews. I love solving challenging problems, I love talking to
people about software problems and I love writing code. So, why do
live coding interviews feel so gross to me?

Well, curiosity got the best of me recently and I tried a few. While I
can’t speak for other engineers, I can confidently say that live
coding interviews are not a good way to vet my technical abilities or
to understand the value I can deliver as a member of an engineering
team.

I’m not a CS grad. But, I have written code professionally for the
past 7 years and held a director level position at two different
companies. While I’ve taken CS classes at MIT and worked as a
researcher there for a few years, I didn’t get the interview training
a CS grad might. Without that practice and training, I fail a basic
coding interview 100% of the time.

As many people have talked about, there is a
[skill to coding in front of people](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) — a
skill that does not necessarily correlate with skill at building
maintainable systems. But, a coding interview is a structured
test. Given the right role, could I get good at passing that test so
that I nail an interview? Certainly. But, as a professional engineer,
when will I have time to git gud at technical interviews? Even if had
time, no one has ever warned me that they are going to give me a
coding interview. It’s a surprise!

## “A wild coding interview appears!”

Live coding isn’t something I expect to do when an engineer asks to “chat”.

For my last “chat”, I met a founder and they wanted me to meet the
lead engineer. Before the call, the engineer sent me a Google Doc with
the text “in case we want to jot down ideas while we chat”. Turns out
that was where we were going to do the coding interview. Wild!

That was an odd case but, usually I get invited to come by an office
and “chat with some people on the team”. Maybe 70% of the time, this
is pretty serious but chill time where we talk about problems and
potential solutions. 30% of the time, a wild coding interview appears!
“Live coding interview” casts some spell where I get put in a tiny
conference room while a guy (always a guy) takes notes as I write code
with a marker. I lose the battle.

**Why not let someone prepare for a live coding interview?**

On the surface, I understand that you don’t want someone to prepare
for a coding interview since they could look up common interview
questions. But, by not telling people, you run the risk that some
people are going to be more prepared than others— by chance. Coding
interviews are a part of some engineering cultures and not
others. That doesn’t make one ‘better’.

A live coding interview is a test that some candidates have studied
for very recently and others have not done in YEARS. By surprising
them, you favor people who have practiced coding interviews in a CS
undergrad program, had professional coding interview training at a
bootcamp, or interviewed at bazillion companies (maybe they can’t hold
a job). If I had a friend at the company, they could give me a heads
up — and then I could prepare. While a ‘surprise live coding
interview’ may make sense to some, it does favor CS grads, people “in
network” and people who can’t hold a job. Wild!

## Live coding interviews are just as much about culture fit as the rest of the interview

As someone unfamiliar with live coding interviews, it is a space where
I know I am being tested, but I don’t know what I am being graded
on. Assumptions are cultural norms.

Without the grading mechanism stated and agreed upon by all parties,
the interviewer can move the goal post. Or, the interviewee may
optimize for something the interviewer doesn’t care about at all.

> When you say ‘coding interview’, I hear ‘we only hire CS grads’.

Here are some of my notes after my last coding interview:
*Note that they have nothing to do with improving my skills as a programmer or communicator.*

*   **First, establish what the interviewer is looking for in the coding interview.**
Usually when you directly ask what the interviewer cares about, they will deflect with ‘we just want to see how you think through problems’. Follow up with “how many questions will we go through in this process?” and “how much time do we have?”. The goal is to understand if the interviewer is evaluating problem solving speed, the performance of the solution (n log n, n2 etc), your ability to communicate as you code (a new skill!) or your familiarity with the language you chose.
*   **Ask to code in pseudocode.**
In my last live coding interview, I was asked to write in a real language but could not use my text editor. Then, I was asked to not worry about making the code syntactically correct. The experience was very jarring and tripped me up a lot. Ask the interviewer if by picking a language, they want to test my understanding of the language or are just trying to make me feel comfortable.
*   **After writing the code, try to break the code in a way visible to the interviewer.**
One of the challenges of coding interviews is going between writing code and talking about code. For engineers who are not formally taught, this practice breaks their learned process causing them to skip steps in live coding that they would not skip in a real coding environment. One of the steps I forgot was to try to break the code I wrote.

### In conclusion

I’m far from a perfect engineer. I’m excellent at some things and
absolutely terrible at others. Want to know what those things are?
Talk to people I’ve worked with (or ask me!) but don’t pretend you can
read between lines of code on a whiteboard.

Much like the SAT when applying for college, live coding is a
structured test. I didn’t go to a school that trained me to do live
coding, and so will probably fail the test. As I’ve experienced it,
live coding isn’t the meritocratic space that it pretends to be. Live
coding interviews weed out the people who are good at live coding
interviews. Those people tend to be CS grads. If that is what you are
looking for, you can just add that to the job requirements and save
everyone time. Please don’t pretend live coding is a good way to vet
candidates on their technical chops.

Some ways to vet people for technical roles that I would be super into
and have seen successfully implemented:

*   Review how a project I built works
*   Talk through designing a system for doing ‘x’
*   Review a real pull request
*   Take home project (I probably won’t have time for it but could talk through it!)
*   Talk to people I’ve worked with

In short, no more live coding interviews for me. For some in depth
looks at alternatives, I highly recommend reading this post by Buffer
