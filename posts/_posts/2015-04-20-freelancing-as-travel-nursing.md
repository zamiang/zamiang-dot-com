# "Lets nurse freelance engineering back to health"

I thought I would love absolutely love freelancing. It turns out, I hate it.

Freelancing promises working on tons of different projects and learning new tech. This just sounds so awesome after spending 5 years at startups, stuck with early technical decisions for years. But, the initial brightness quickly dimmed. It is incredibly challenging to be a product focused engineer as a freelance "outsider".

I genuinely believe that the core of being a good engineer is being good at doing less stuff. "Less But Better" is a phrase I think about a lot. Make it faster? Do less and cache it. Do we need this new thing? If so, did someone else already make it. Cool… done. Lets move on to more interesting problems. Big project? Lets break it up into lots of isolated components and parallelize. It turns out, this line of thinking makes for a terrible freelancer! Could we just setup x.ly in an hour or two and be done? Oh wait… I am paid by the hour and made no money. Crap.

## What is my job as a freelancer?

Oddly, thinking about how to make the product succeed while imposing as little technical debt as possible isn't my job as a freelancer. My job is to get the project done to spec. As a freelancer, I am not there to think about whether this is the right product for the problem. My job is to build, document and move on.

Sadly, "build it, document and move on" doesn't make much sense for building products people use. I've never built a product used exactly as planned. Project billing misunderstands the dynamic process of building tools for humans. You build, learn and improve. Making products for people is about how quickly you can iterate and how much knowledge you can generate with each attempt. What if freelancing roles and incentives better matched this path to success?

## Nursing freelancing back to health

Maybe we can learn something from other professions with staffing shortage. How about nursing?

My brother is preparing to start out as a traveling nurse. The [traveling nursing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_nursing) position was created as a response to nursing shortages. When a hospital starts to staff up, they bring traveling nurses onto the team for 3 months to hold them out in the interim. Since there is an engineering shortage, I wonder if it is possible to apply the travel nursing model to engineering.

At Artsy, did something not unlike this. We hired by starting engineers with a three month contract to try out the relationship. Even if things did not work out, we would get a good amount of value out of the relationship. They would start and be on boarded in a couple days and then start picking up tickets. Eventually they would take on a project or work on fixing problems on their own.

'There be dragons' when applying a model from a formal field and to an informal field like programming. Why not think about hiring freelancers as bringing in reinforcements. Have an engineer join the organization for a short period of time. Maybe if you treat people like they are integral to to the success of something awesome, they will act like it.

This role of 'make stuff more awesome' is an abstract, traditionally full-time role, but I wonder if it makes sense in our current tech climate.

Nurse!
