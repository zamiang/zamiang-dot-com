I thought I would love absolutely love freelancing. It turns out, I hate it.

Freelancing promises working on tons of different projects and learning new tech. This just sounds so awesome after spending 5 years at startups, stuck with early technical decisions for years. But, the initial brightness quickly dimmed after I realized that being an "outsider" just doesn't work as a product focused engineer.

I genuinely believe that the core of being a good engineer is being good at doing less stuff. "Less But Better" is a phrase I think about a lot. Make it faster? Do less and cache it. Do we need this new thing? If so, did someone else already make it. Cool… done. Lets move on to more interesting problems. Big project? Lets break it up into lots of isolated components and parallelize. It turns out, this line of thinking makes for a terrible freelancer! Could we just setup x.ly in an hour or two and be done? Oh wait… I am paid by the hour and made no money. Crap.

## What is my job as a freelancer?

Weirdly enough, thinking about how to make the product succeed while imposing as little technical coast as possible isn't my job as a freelancer. My job is to get the project done to spec. As a freelancer, I am not there to think about whether this is the right product for the problem, I am hear to build, document and move on.

Sadly, build it, document and move on really doesn't make much sense for building products people use. I've never built a product that was used exactly as planned. Project billing misunderstands the dynamic nature of building tools for the diverse set of people using the web. You build, learn and improve. The success of your product depends on how quickly you can iterate and then how much knowledge you can generate with each attempt.

## Lets make something awesome

Why not, phrase freelancing as 'lets make this as awesome as we can in x weeks for y dollars'?

The role of 'make stuff more awesome' is a bit of an abstract, traditionally non-contractable role, but I wonder if it makes sense in our current tech climate. My brother is about to start out as a traveling nurse. The [traveling nursing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_nursing) position was created as a response to nursing shortages. While a hospital starts to staff up, they hire traveling nurses for 3 months to hold them out in the interim. Since there is an engineering shortage, I wonder if it is possible to take this model, apply it to engineering.

Unlike engineering, nursing has a complex series of certifications for specific nursing roles to mitigate risk. This allows somone who was trained in North Carolina to work in California. With product engineering the risks aren't life or death but they are significant. Onboarding engineers into the peculiarities of your setup takes time, but the real cost is alignment.

## Alignment

The challenge of working with contractors is immense. Maybe it is simply trying to create a system that quickly aligns freelancers with the goals of the organization. They

Alignment on product goals

The cost of hiring is really
I can see this working in some scenarios, particularly where it helps to have someone on site, but maybe not going forward.
