I am incredibly excited to announce I've joined [Motivate](https://twitter.com/motivate_co) as their Director of Engineering, Software and Integrations.

Motivate’s mission is to make our cities more pedestrian-friendly by building and operating bike share programs that people love and use every day. Motivate creates and manages all aspects of CitiBike and 7 other bikeshare programs around the world, from building the apps to operating the warehouses. Under [new ownership](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/01/14/us/ap-us-bike-share-new-name.html?_r=0), Motivate is growing into an [integrated](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/01/a-conversation-jay-walder-the-man-running-motivate-the-nations-biggest-bike-share-company/384534/), biking-focused tech company with a consistent user interface and management tools for all of our programs.

As an engineer and biker looking to affect change within cities, I could not be more excited to be a part of this mission. Since [leaving Artsy](http://www.zamiang.com/posts/post/2015/03/15/leaving-artsy/), I’ve been working on ways to [better understand our cities](http://vislet.com). I see bike shares as one pillar of a liveable modern city. Not only are bike shares an amenity every city should have, they also open the door to pedestrian-friendly municipal policies like [slow traffic zones](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2013-10-neighborhood-slow-zones-clinton-hill-bed-stuy-bk.pdf), [strict traffic laws](http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-toughens-traffic-laws-to-reduce-pedestrian-deaths-1401414941), and other "[vision zero](http://www.nyc.gov/html/visionzero/pages/home/home.shtml)" initiatives that make our cities more safe.

Perhaps the most exciting part of my job is that I've been tasked with building out an all-star engineering team to start making our systems more open, more fully featured and more consistent.
