This is the start of a series about the lessons I learned while directing the web engineering team at Artsy. Artsy is a website that seeks to bring the art market online, and in the process, make the art world easily accessible to everyone. It has now raised over [50m](http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/03/26/catterton-leads-25-million-funding-round-for-artsy/) and has made it to that in-between phase where it is ['not a startup not yet a company'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlV7RhT6zHs).

Being apart of that change was an incredible opportunity. While I was at Artsy, the company matured and grew from 15 to about 90 people. Since leaving, it has further matured and staff count is over 100. Each of these people probably have their own list of things Artsy does right or wrong, but this list is mine. The hopes that this helps me build on Artsy's success in future roles. My knowledge, and these lessons, reflect my experience within engineering team and not the company as a whole.

# Hiring awesome people

Hiring is the most important thing to get right at a startup but is also the hardest. Finding smart, motivated people who work well together is virtually impossible. If Artsy has a secret sauce, it is how it hires. All else falls from the assumption that they have hired the best people who want to work together to achieve Artsy’s mission.

## Finding awesome people

The first step in hiring is defining the position. Artsy does a great job crafting aspirational rather than clinical job descriptions. Within engineering, the job postings focus on challenges, ownership, opportunities for growth and quality of team. In keeping with this high level approach, Artsy lists  qualifications as fundamentals rather than 'x years doing y'.

Even with a great job posting, reaching engineers is challenging. At a recent event, a CEO just interrupted conversations to ask people if they were developers, and if so, pitched his company. Artsy values the unique knowledge and contributions of individual engineers. It demonstrates these values through contributing to open source, blogging, speaking and targeted press. During this process, engineers begin to understand Artsy, and Artsy understands individual engineers. Rather than yelling 'developers!, developers! developers!' in crowded room, in Artsy uses this knowledge to vet and make dedicated offers to individual engineers.

The key takeaway here, is that the key to finding great people is making the hiring process about people. Artsy's process is in direct contrast with my current role. Engineering applicants need to create an account on our hiring portal and fill out a 12 page form before we can contact them. This severely limits our applicant pool. Artsy keeps the barriers to 'first contact' low through online contact via OSS/blogging and by inviting candidates to a casual team event or coffee.

## Evaluating awesome people

If you could choose between an doing interview or doing references which would you pick?

Artsy is very much in the 'references' camp but does continue to do interviews -- it just does them non-traditionally. A rigorous process for finding highly targeted people to interview enables a different interview process. Instead of a rigorous evaluation, Artsy uses the interview to answer questions about the candidates experience and then focuses on selling the candidate on the company.

This lack of focus on the interview, stems from the belief that it is impossible to tell good from great in an interview for creative or technical roles. The interview is a highly artificial environment that does not compare to how the individual creates value day to day. Interviews are also unreliable because the process plays on our biases. We often "value intuition over historical data" and "valuing people who are similar to us". We are also influenced by quick and superficial qualities such as attractiveness, race or background which have nothing to do with their ability to perform. Some companies change their interview process to fix all of these issues. Artsy solves this by acknowledging these biases (and communicating them) and focuses on references.

Artsy's secret weapon in evaluating candidates is doing references in a thorough way. Artsy believes that 'references are not a defense against hiring poorly, they are a way to hire great people'. There are a variety of techniques for improving reference calls. In general, the goal is to see questions like "What are your general thoughts on x's performance?" and "How was working with x?" as warmup questions rather than the meat of the call. The call can focus on more substantive questions where you ask the reference to compare 'x' against other people. For example, 'Are they the best person you've worked with in that role?', 'Why are they not the best?'. Ask about what get the person excited and what makes them happy. Just like when seeking out individuals, the references call is about gaining a better understanding of the individual. The goal is to understand who they are as an individual and whether they will be able to perform at a high level in your organization.

Just like interviews, references have many biases and issues. Consider the strength of the reference and the general strength of employees from that company. Ideally someone experienced in the industry, with has a wide network tied into many similar companies, should do the reference call. After doing many interviews and references, you will understand which organizations have consistently awesome people and which don't.

## Closing on hiring awesome people

The closing process is just as high touch as you've been all along. If you either make an offer or reject the candidate, do so thoughtfully - incorporating feedback from references and interviews. Deciding whether to make an offer is always difficult but is really asking ['Is this someone you would actively seek to work with?'](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-engineering-interview-process-like-at-Stripe)

During the closing process, salary negotiations will come up. The negotiation is not an opportunity to try to get the most out of a person for the least amount of money. Salary negotiators are unfair and inconsistent with any organization that values actual human beings. As Artsy states, 'compensation is a function of the value of the candidate based on market rate, the value the company brings to the candidate and the market in between'. For figuring out market rate, dB of Artsy recommends [responding to recruiter spam](http://code.dblock.org/2015/01/09/how-to-make-recruiter-spam-useful-my-canned-response.html) to ask about market rate.

When closing, consider other factors that may go into them accepting the offer. Don't hesitate to bring in references or investors to support making the hire. If they accept, send a something personalized with handwritten note and anything you think might generally interest the candidate errr… new hire - Congrats!

# Takeaways

After moving on to a different company, one of the most interesting takeaways is how challenging it is to enact a hiring process like this. You can't pick and choose various convenient or 'easy' parts of Artsy's hiring process, and just apply them at a new company. Each step builds on the previous one - such a with the closing process. Often you learn information that helps you close on a hire during a references call - you can't get that information without doing references thoroughly.

Another challenge with implementing this is time. It takes time and effort to create a human centered hiring process. At my current company, we mostly race to do things that needed doing yesterday. As a result we don't plan or strategize much at all. Additionally, we work in deep Sunset Park, Brooklyn where we are over an hour from a convenient coffee place Manhattan. The first step in this process is implementing some kind of forward looking product process (probably a 2-3 week sprint) where we plan, and execute items.
