I am incredibly excited to announce I've joined Motivate as their Director of Engineering, Software and Integrations.

Motivate’s mission is to make our cities more pedestrian friendly by building bike shares that people love and use every day. Motivate runs CitiBike and 7 other bike share programs around the world. It creates and manages all aspects bike shares from the apps to the warehouses. Under [new ownership](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/01/14/us/ap-us-bike-share-new-name.html?_r=0), Motivate is growing into an [integrated](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/01/a-conversation-jay-walder-the-man-running-motivate-the-nations-biggest-bike-share-company/384534/), biking focused tech company. As an engineer and biker looking to affect change within cities, this is an ideal opportunity for me.

Beyond the mission, this appeals to me because I see bikeshares as one pillars of a liveable modern city. Bikeshares are integral to the success of policies like [slow traffic zones](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2013-10-neighborhood-slow-zones-clinton-hill-bed-stuy-bk.pdf), [strict traffic laws](http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-toughens-traffic-laws-to-reduce-pedestrian-deaths-1401414941), and other "[vision zero](http://www.nyc.gov/html/visionzero/pages/home/home.shtml)" initiatives. With cities more dense than ever, we need great tools, such as bike shares, and policies like vision zero to make this increase in density safe and enjoyable. I could not be more excited to be joining in this mission.

If you want to make cities better with us, we are hiring engineers and designers. Please drop me a line and include links to what you’ve built: [email me](mailto:brennanmoore@motivateco.com)
